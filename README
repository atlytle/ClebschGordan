Moved "binomial" object declaration to ClebschGordan.cpp.
Needed to use dynamic linking [https://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html]
to get Lapack libraries included. 
use_ClebschGordan.py works after build.

Include "weight" class in ClebschGordan.i. These are the function
arguments to the downstream functions I want to use, so we
need to be able to create these. This didn't work 'out of the box'

doesn't have access to memory. Instead introduced new
get/set functionality. Thank you to Kevin Ingles for assistance
with this.
