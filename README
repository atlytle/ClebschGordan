------------
Installed swig. Testing example from https://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html
Minimal example works as advertised.

Extending swig example to ClebschGordan.
Split header off from ClebschGordan.cpp.
Expose binomial_t implementation to swig interface in ClebschGordan.i

------------
Moved "binomial" object declaration to ClebschGordan.cpp.
Needed to use dynamic linking [https://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html]
to get Lapack libraries included. 
use_ClebschGordan.py works after build.

Include "weight" class in ClebschGordan.i. These are the function
arguments to the downstream functions I want to use, so we
need to be able to create these. This didn't work 'out of the box'
because the C++ constructors don't set the weights directly, and python
doesn't have access to memory. Instead introduced new
get/set functionality. Thank you to Kevin Ingles for assistance
with this.

Factorise use_ClebschGordan.py. Reproduces behavior of
5) Calculate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for S x S' -> S'' of ClebschGordan.cpp

-------------
Set up comparisons between C++ code and sympy SU(2) CGs.

06 June, 2024
-------------
Start thinking about a port of the C++ code. Work in CGport.py.

Fixed error in in CG_swig() [m1<-->m2] in coeffs(m1, m2,..).
This passed test_CG_swig() because I had only tested w1==w2.
Generalized to CG_swig(w1, w2, w3), verified tests pass.
